<h2>FSUIPC Support</h2>
The most recent addition to <b>fsr</b> was support for video playback via Peter Dowson's <a href="http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html"  target="_blank">FSUIPC facility</a>.  The hope was that some of the "jumpiness" that was being experienced during playback would disappear when using FSUIPC.  Though this result was not realized, playback using FSUIPC has some other interesting features so its support is being left in for now.
