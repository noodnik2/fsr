RE:	First Release of Flight Simulator Replay


This is the README file accompanying the first general release of the Flight
Simulator Replay (fsr) program.

In the normal case, Flight Simulator Replay is installed into the "Program Files" directory, e.g.:

	"C:\Program Files\Marty Ross\Flight Simulator Replay"

The samples that are included (if you checked the "Include Samples?" check-
box during installation) are actual recordings of flights I've taken.  There
are several ".ctl" (Cetus Gps) recordings and a single NMEA data stream.  In
order to "run" these samples, do the following:

(1) start Microsoft Flight Simulator

(2) start the Flight Simulator Replay (fsr) program

(3) load one of the sample files (located in the
	"Samples" sub-directory) by using the browse
	button in the "Input" area

(4) [optional] first convert the track log file
	to FSR (Flight Simulator Recording) format by
	entering a filename with the extension ".fsr"
	into the "Output" area and clicking on the
	"Convert" button.  You can either play the
	resulting video by loading it into the
	simulator's "Play Video" function, or by
	copying the FSR file name into the "Input"
	area and clicking the "Play" button (as in
	step #5, below)
	 
(5) play the file directly in Flight Simulator by
	checking the "Play in simulator" button, then
	clicking the "Play" button.  You should then
	see Microsoft Flight Simulator start to load
	the necessary scenery and start the playback.
	
Here are the flight tracklogs's that are in "Samples":
			
	0404OAK2LAXP1.ctl
	0404OAK2LAXP2.ctl
		These two track logs are actually the entire trip from
		KOAK to KLAX in a B-737.  There's a really nice 360 turn
		for spacing that you'll see on the downwind for LAX.

	031114-05u.nmea
		This one was a while ago, but I think it's some pattern
		practice at Santa Monica in Skyward's Grumman AA1-C trainer.
	
	la_tour.ctl
		This is some pattern work and a scenic trip around Los
		Angeles downtown in a Cherokee Warrior PA-161.
	
	smo_pat-dave.ctl
		My friend Dave in a loop around the SMO pattern.
